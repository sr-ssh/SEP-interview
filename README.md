# Project Overview
This project is the interview task of SEP. The goal of the project is to validate my skills in coding.

# Technologies Used
This project was built using ReactJs, RTK Query, and MUI. While the recommended technologies for the project were Axios and SASS, I chose to use RTK Query and MUI instead. Here's why:

- **RTK Query**: In my experience, RTK Query offers a more streamlined and efficient way to manage data and make API requests. By using RTK Query, I am able to easily manage the state of my application and avoid the need for manual data fetching and caching. This allows me to write more concise and maintainable code.

- **MUI**: MUI provides a wide range of pre-built components and styles that can help to speed up the development process. By using MUI, I can ensure a consistent and intuitive user experience, while also taking advantage of a well-documented set of components.

While I recognize the value of the recommended technologies, I believe that my expertise in RTK Query and MUI will allow me to deliver the best possible solution for this particular project.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
